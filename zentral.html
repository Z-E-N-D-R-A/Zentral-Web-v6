            <span>The Guardian in the Woods</span><br>
            Long before the roads were paved and the train lines stitched cities together, there was a small mountain village tucked into
            the forests east of Okayama. It did not appear on most maps. Travelers who passed nearby often missed it entirely, as if the
            trees themselves leaned inward to hide it. The village had no grand shrine, no famous landmark. What it had was a story. <br><br>

            Generations ago, when the village was little more than wooden houses and terraced fields, the elders spoke of a fox named <b>Kura</b>.
            Kura was said to have fur like burnished copper in daylight, but at night his outline shimmered faintly blue. He was never seen clearly.
            Only glimpsed. A tail disappearing behind cedar trunks. A pair of quiet eyes watching from the ridge.<br><br>

            The legend began with a storm. One summer, long ago, rains flooded the valley. The river swelled beyond its banks and threatened to swallow
            the rice fields of the village. The villagers prayed at their small shrine, unsure what more could be done. That night, a young girl claimed
            she saw a fox standing in the river. The current curved around him as if afraid. By morning, the waters had shifted course. The fields were spared.
            No one could explain how. From that day on, the elders would say: <br>
            <i>“Kura walks where danger gathers.”</i><br><br>
            Some called him a kitsune spirit, others a wandering guardian. Children left small offerings of rice at the forest’s edge. Farmers bowed toward
            the hills before planting season. Over centuries, the story became tradition. Then into rumor. Then into something whispered during festivals under
            lantern light.
        </p>

    <section class="story section2 reveal" style="padding-top: 0">
        <p class="story-text">
            <span>The Blue Moon</span><br>
            Centuries passed. Wooden homes became reinforced structures. Electricity hummed softly through the valley. The world beyond the mountains moved faster each year.
            And then the Earth began to tremble. Cups rattled. Birds scattered from the trees. Within moments, the shaking grew violent. The village split in sound and dust.
            Roofs cracked. Walls fell. The forest roared as if something ancient had woken beneath it. And then, as suddenly as it began, the shaking stopped. Silence followed. <br><br>
            
            When the villagers looked up, the sky had changed. The moon hung enormous above the valley. Blue. Not pale. Not silver. Blue like deep ocean glass. The elders fell
            to their knees. They remembered. From the center of that impossible moonlight, something descended, stepping between light itself. A fox. <br><br>
            
            His fur shimmered like starlit water. His eyes burned steady and calm. He touched the earth, and the remaining tremors faded as if soothed. Kura had returned. Not as rumor.
            Not as story. But as guardian once more. The cracks in the village did not widen further. Fires that had sparked from fallen lanterns flickered out. The forest, which had
            seemed ready to swallow everything, quieted.

        <p class="story-text">
            That same night, not far from the valley, someone else wandered beneath the trembling trees. ゼンダ ・クレイジー (Zenda Kureiji). Lost. He wasn't from the village. He hadn’t
            grown up hearing the legend. He hadn’t bowed to the forest before harvest season. He was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time — caught in the earthquake while traveling
            near the mountains. The roads split. His sense of direction vanished. Dust and fear filled the air. He ran. Not toward safety, just away from collapse. <br><br>

            When exhaustion finally overtook Zenda, he stumbled into a clearing lit by blue light. The moon above him was not normal. And the fox standing ahead of him was not ordinary.
            Kura was not surprised to see him. He did not retreat. He simply waited. He was not meant to find the village. But he had. And Kura, who belonged to no one, stepped closer.
            The path back to the valley seemed to unfold naturally.

    <section class="story section3 reveal">
        <p class="story-text">
            <span>The Birth of Zentrals</span><br>
            Zenda did not claim to control Kura. He was simply the outsider who arrived when the sky turned blue, the one Kura decided to remain near. And the villagers, who had once whispered
            legends by lantern light, began writing new ones. They started calling themselves something different, not just residents or survivors. They became the <b>Zentrals</b>. The word
            carried weight. It meant those who stand at the center when things shake. Those who hold steady when the Earth shifts. Those who protect one another the way Kura protected them.
            And soon, Zenda has also started being known as <b>Zendra</b>. The village itself took on a new name as well: <b>The Zentralverse</b>. It was still a place of fields and forests, of cedar scent and mountain air.
            But it was also something larger now. A living legend. <br><br>

            Kura never returned to the sky. He stayed near Zendra as a companion. The blue moon faded by the next night, returning to its ordinary silver glow. Scientists from distant cities
            would later speak of atmospheric illusions, rare lunar scattering, seismic coincidences. The villagers only smiled. They knew what they saw.  The earthquake became part of the story,
            not as tragedy, but as awakening. The legend was no longer something told about the past. It was unfolding in the present.<br><br>

            The Zentralverse is still that village near Okayama. But it is also the people who carry its spirit wherever they go. A Zentral is anyone who believes that chaos can be survived,
            legends are not meant to fade, and guardians do will always stay. And somewhere, in the quiet between tremors and moonlight, a fox with faintly glowing fur still walks the ridgeline. 
            Not because he must. But because he chooses to. And once Kura chooses you — You are never truly lost again.
